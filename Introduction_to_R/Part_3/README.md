**Welcome to the data visualisation portion of this Introduction to R course.**

This week will rely heavily on the use of the `ggplot2` R package. Go ahead and install the package now by running `install.packages('ggplot2')` in R studio. Read the learning materials to find out about :sparkles: **the magic of `ggplot2`** :sparkles: and then attempt the worksheet to make some pretty plotsâ€‹. All relevant links below:
